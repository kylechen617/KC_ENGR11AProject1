This project helped me learn how to solder, create fusion models, problem solve, and the capabilities of laser cutting. The most important part of the project came. What I enjoyed the most was coming up with a method to improve the usability of the tiny buttons on the circuit board.</p>

                                Having forgotten the little experience I had soldering in my early years of high school, I enjoyed learning how to solder again despite being paired up with a slightly defective soldering iron. After two classes I was able to finish soldering using a different soldering iron that had a wide flat head like tip. It was pretty helpful after I got used to the iron as it was able to solder two joints at once.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-white-50 mb-4">We started by making a box with a sliding lid in fusion. Our first iteration was to understand how the box would work once it was printed. It was a little undersized because we didn't account for the battery pack that was also supposed to fit inside of the enclosure and we also hadn't added the hole for the buttons yet. However, one of the biggest problems we encoutered was the sliding lid being too big to fit into the slot. Because the plastic expanded as it cooled, we then added more clearance between the two pieces before we printed the next iteration. Our second version was the perfect size for fitting both the battery pack and clock. The only problem we still had was the lid being too large, so we sanded it down. I also added buttons to make them much easier to use.

                                Making the laser cut design was very challenging for me since I had a difficult time trying to visualize how the pieces would all fit together without the help of Fusion. It was very helpful to look at inspiration around the room for building the finger joints. Once it was time to print, the process felt intimidating because of the power and size of the machine but it was really suprising at how fast it managed to cut the pieces out. Unlike 3D printing, there was almost no need to give clearance for any of the connecting pieces to account for the expansion of the material. In fact it felt counter intuitive to have clearance since they would have just resulted in small gaps throughout the box. Finally, putting together all of the pieces felt very rewarding and it was nice to be able to get a glimpse of the capabilities and restrictions of another important design instrument which was much different from 3D Printing.
