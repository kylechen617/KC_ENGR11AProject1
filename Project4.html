                                We used the files from the e-Nable website for the Phoenix Hand v3. E-Nable is a non-profit organization that focuses on delivering free prosthetics for those who need it. They are sourced from people all over the world who voluntarily print and assemble 3D printed prosthetic hands making it a great open source design. To print the parts out for the hand, we first started by scaling the entire file by 150% Then we isolated the small pieces to print them all in one batch. They were then printed with supports. We also individually printed the palm and gauntlet without supports. All of the prints turned out well. However, we did figure out that the supports were unecesary and difficult to remove.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-white-50 mb-4">Once we had all the pieces printed and had the gauntlet thermoformed,  we began watching the video 1 linked on the e-Nable's website. It was pretty difficult to follow because the pin pieces were very similar and when they were mentioned during the video it was hard to distinguish which one was being used. The written manual solved all of our pin issues because it told us that there were small letters on the pieces to show which part they were. With this information, we used the written manual since the video would only give instructions like "the shortest thumb pin." However, the video did do a good job at showing where the tension ropes went through the palm. The manual only had a diagram of the strings making it hard to imagine how they fit into the 3D object. So we ended up using the manual to find how they fit together and the video for the tension strings. We did run into some difficulties while trying to knot the end of the string when it was barely long enough. At the end we had the finished product in the picture which could grab and release based on the orientation of the wrist.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal b-4 mt-5 mb-10">
                                My idea for the modification of the arm was to add a function to keep it in a locked gripped position. Taking inspiration from "What can a body do?" by Sarah Hendren, I felt that it would be best for me to try to add a simple function that could be useful to everyone since I don't have the experience to make a product for someone who is disabled. That's where I came up with the idea to make a function to keep the hand closed, so they didn't need to keep their wrist bent constantly. To make this modification I changed the sliding mechanism so that it could go back and forth and also added two small bumps that would hold the tensioner in position. This would in turn tighten the strings and keeps the hand in the grabbing position. I also flipped the tensioner so that the bump would be oriented towards the palm.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal b-4 mt-5 mb-10">
                                This whole development process really helped me change how I think about how we all live life differently and design thinking. I had always understood that people with disabilities did not interact with the world in the same way that I did but Sarah hendren did an amazing job at conveying this, stating:"every day every body is at odds with the built environment...each flesh envelope is miraculous and mundane in this way, lugging all its gear and getting where it needs to go" (Sarah Hendre, What can a Body Do?). Her book focused on how the world is for only a specific type of "normal" person. Which forgets that humans are all super unique meaning that instead of people conforming to fit the "normal" person, it makes much more sense for the environment to be made to conform around us. This made me realize that when thinking about design you need to forget about your prejudices and ideas about how things have been done. Especially because it doesn't make sense to build something for someone when you don't know exactly what they want.
