                    <p>Having never done any 3D printing before, the Prusa Slicer app made it really easy to understand the basics of how to upload and print designs. When I downloaded the 3MF file it was already formatted to work in the software so all I had to do was edit the text before slicing and uploading it into the usb. However,I had somehow deleted the filament change in the design. Aside from that it was incredible seeing how simple it was to get the printer started. In a short few minutes it had finished printing the name tag. In the picture the tag kept all the detail and looked nearly the same as the original file besides a few missed connections.</p></div>

                        <p>To test the limits of the printer I had initially chosen a small cat whose legs had propped its body off the base plate and sported a sharply curved tail. As the software pointed out I believed the printer would fail at the intense overhang created by the tail and the lack of the support for the body. Immediately after it started to print the first layer failed to adhere to the base and began sticking to the nozzle so I tried making a stress cube instead. And, to my complete surprise, the printer perfectly printed the 90 degree overhangs and diagonal lines. After finally printing the x on the pedestal from the image below did I have a good representation for the limits of the printer. In the areas where the x came off at 90 degrees from the middle, there were strings of PLA that seem to randomly hang off the bottom due to a lack of support. The print helped me learn that while the printer can handle some pretty impressive overhang, it will fail if pushed. The first layer is also one of the main sources of error especially when adhesion is low. Finally 3MF files contain more printing and design information compared to STL. </p>
